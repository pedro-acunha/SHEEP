# SHEEP
Machine Learning pipeline to classify astronomical sources into galaxies, quasars and stars using photometric data.
It was built to deal with the broad galaxy, QSO and star classification problem using tabular data. Our approach uses SDSS and WISE photometry, however others types of data (if tabular) are compatible with our architecture, e.g. radio fluxes/magnitudes.
