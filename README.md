# SHEEP
Photometric redshift-aided classification pipeline using ensemble learning to classify astronomical sources into galaxies, quasars and stars.
It was built to deal with tabular data, while allowing the use of sparse data.
Our approach uses SDSS and WISE photometry, however others types of data (if tabular) are compatible with our architecture, e.g. radio fluxes/magnitudes.
